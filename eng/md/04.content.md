## Numbers 11:2 (id: 2004011002)

2The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.


## Numbers 11:3 (id: 2004011003)

3The name of that place was called Taberah, because Yahweh’s fire burned among them.


## Numbers 11:4 (id: 2004011004)

4The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat?


## Numbers 11:5 (id: 2004011005)

5We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;


## Numbers 11:6 (id: 2004011006)

6but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.”


## Numbers 11:7 (id: 2004011007)

7The manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium.


## Numbers 11:8 (id: 2004011008)

8The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.


## Numbers 11:9 (id: 2004011009)

9When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.


## Numbers 11:10 (id: 2004011010)

10Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and Yahweh’s anger burned greatly; and Moses was displeased.


## Numbers 11:11 (id: 2004011011)

11Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?


## Numbers 11:12 (id: 2004011012)

12Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers’?


## Numbers 11:13 (id: 2004011013)

13Where could I get meat to give all these people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’


## Numbers 11:14 (id: 2004011014)

14I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.


## Numbers 11:15 (id: 2004011015)

15If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.”


## Numbers 11:16 (id: 2004011016)

16Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.


## Numbers 11:17 (id: 2004011017)

17I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you don’t bear it yourself alone.


## Numbers 11:18 (id: 2004011018)

18“Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore Yahweh will give you meat, and you will eat.


## Numbers 11:19 (id: 2004011019)

19You will not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,


## Numbers 11:20 (id: 2004011020)

20but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”


## Numbers 11:21 (id: 2004011021)

21Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month.’


## Numbers 11:22 (id: 2004011022)

22Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?”


## Numbers 11:23 (id: 2004011023)

23Yahweh said to Moses, “Has Yahweh’s hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.”


## Numbers 11:24 (id: 2004011024)

24Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh’s words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.


## Numbers 11:25 (id: 2004011025)

25Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.


## Numbers 11:26 (id: 2004011026)

26But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.


## Numbers 11:27 (id: 2004011027)

27A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”


## Numbers 11:28 (id: 2004011028)

28Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses, forbid them!”


## Numbers 11:29 (id: 2004011029)

29Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh’s people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!”


## Numbers 11:30 (id: 2004011030)

30Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.


## Numbers 11:31 (id: 2004011031)

31A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.


## Numbers 11:32 (id: 2004011032)

32The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp.


## Numbers 11:33 (id: 2004011033)

33While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh’s anger burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.


## Numbers 11:34 (id: 2004011034)

34The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.


## Numbers 11:35 (id: 2004011035)

35From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.


## Numbers 12:1 (id: 2004012001)

1Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.


## Numbers 12:2 (id: 2004012002)

2They said, “Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn’t he spoken also with us?” And Yahweh heard it.


## Numbers 12:3 (id: 2004012003)

3Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men who were on the surface of the earth.


## Numbers 12:4 (id: 2004012004)

4Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, “You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!” The three of them came out.


## Numbers 12:5 (id: 2004012005)

5Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.


## Numbers 12:6 (id: 2004012006)

6He said, “Now hear my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.


## Numbers 12:7 (id: 2004012007)

7My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.


## Numbers 12:8 (id: 2004012008)

8With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Yahweh’s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?”


## Numbers 12:9 (id: 2004012009)

9Yahweh’s anger burned against them; and he departed.


## Numbers 12:10 (id: 2004012010)

10The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.


## Numbers 12:11 (id: 2004012011)

11Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.


## Numbers 12:12 (id: 2004012012)

12Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”


## Numbers 12:13 (id: 2004012013)

13Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, “Heal her, God, I beg you!”


## Numbers 12:14 (id: 2004012014)

14Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn’t she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.”


## Numbers 12:15 (id: 2004012015)

15Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t travel until Miriam was brought in again.


## Numbers 12:16 (id: 2004012016)

16Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.


## Numbers 13:1 (id: 2004013001)

1Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 13:2 (id: 2004013002)

2“Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them.”


## Numbers 13:3 (id: 2004013003)

3Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh. All of them were men who were heads of the children of Israel.

15Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.


## Numbers 13:16 (id: 2004013016)

16These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.


## Numbers 13:17 (id: 2004013017)

17Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country.


## Numbers 13:18 (id: 2004013018)

18See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;


## Numbers 13:19 (id: 2004013019)

19and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;


## Numbers 13:20 (id: 2004013020)

20and what the land is, whether it is fertile or poor, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first\-ripe grapes.


## Numbers 13:21 (id: 2004013021)

21So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.


## Numbers 13:22 (id: 2004013022)

22They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)


## Numbers 13:23 (id: 2004013023)

23They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.


## Numbers 13:24 (id: 2004013024)

24That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.


## Numbers 13:25 (id: 2004013025)

25They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.


## Numbers 13:26 (id: 2004013026)

26They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land.


## Numbers 13:27 (id: 2004013027)

27They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.


## Numbers 13:28 (id: 2004013028)

28However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.


## Numbers 13:29 (id: 2004013029)

29Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.”


## Numbers 13:30 (id: 2004013030)

30Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let’s go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”


## Numbers 13:31 (id: 2004013031)

31But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.”


## Numbers 13:32 (id: 2004013032)

32They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.


## Numbers 13:33 (id: 2004013033)

33There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim. We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”


## Numbers 14:1 (id: 2004014001)

1All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.


## Numbers 14:2 (id: 2004014002)

2All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness!


## Numbers 14:3 (id: 2004014003)

3Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return into Egypt?”


## Numbers 14:4 (id: 2004014004)

4They said to one another, “Let’s choose a leader, and let’s return into Egypt.”


## Numbers 14:5 (id: 2004014005)

5Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.


## Numbers 14:6 (id: 2004014006)

6Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes.


## Numbers 14:7 (id: 2004014007)

7They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land.


## Numbers 14:8 (id: 2004014008)

8If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which flows with milk and honey.


## Numbers 14:9 (id: 2004014009)

9Only don’t rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us. Don’t fear them.”


## Numbers 14:10 (id: 2004014010)

10But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. Yahweh’s glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.


## Numbers 14:11 (id: 2004014011)

11Yahweh said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? How long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?


## Numbers 14:12 (id: 2004014012)

12I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”


## Numbers 14:13 (id: 2004014013)

13Moses said to Yahweh, “Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them.


## Numbers 14:14 (id: 2004014014)

14They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Yahweh are among this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.


## Numbers 14:15 (id: 2004014015)

15Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,


## Numbers 14:16 (id: 2004014016)

16‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.’


## Numbers 14:17 (id: 2004014017)

17Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,


## Numbers 14:18 (id: 2004014018)

18‘Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.’


## Numbers 14:19 (id: 2004014019)

19Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.”


## Numbers 14:20 (id: 2004014020)

20Yahweh said, “I have pardoned according to your word;


## Numbers 14:21 (id: 2004014021)

21but in very deed—as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with Yahweh’s glory—


## Numbers 14:22 (id: 2004014022)

22because all those men who have seen my glory and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;


## Numbers 14:23 (id: 2004014023)

23surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it.


## Numbers 14:24 (id: 2004014024)

24But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring shall possess it.


## Numbers 14:25 (id: 2004014025)

25Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”


## Numbers 14:26 (id: 2004014026)

26Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,


## Numbers 14:27 (id: 2004014027)

27“How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that complain against me? I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel, which they complain against me.


## Numbers 14:28 (id: 2004014028)

28Tell them, ‘As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you.


## Numbers 14:29 (id: 2004014029)

29Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have complained against me,


## Numbers 14:30 (id: 2004014030)

30surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.


## Numbers 14:31 (id: 2004014031)

31But I will bring in your little ones that you said should be captured or killed, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.


## Numbers 14:32 (id: 2004014032)

32But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.


## Numbers 14:33 (id: 2004014033)

33Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness.


## Numbers 14:34 (id: 2004014034)

34After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.’


## Numbers 14:35 (id: 2004014035)

35I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.”


## Numbers 14:36 (id: 2004014036)

36The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land,


## Numbers 14:37 (id: 2004014037)

37even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.


## Numbers 14:38 (id: 2004014038)

38But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.


## Numbers 14:39 (id: 2004014039)

39Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.


## Numbers 14:40 (id: 2004014040)

40They rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised; for we have sinned.”


## Numbers 14:41 (id: 2004014041)

41Moses said, “Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it shall not prosper?


## Numbers 14:42 (id: 2004014042)

42Don’t go up, for Yahweh isn’t among you; that way you won’t be struck down before your enemies.


## Numbers 14:43 (id: 2004014043)

43For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you will fall by the sword because you turned back from following Yahweh; therefore Yahweh will not be with you.”


## Numbers 14:44 (id: 2004014044)

44But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and Moses didn’t depart out of the camp.


## Numbers 14:45 (id: 2004014045)

45Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down even to Hormah.


## Numbers 15:1 (id: 2004015001)

1Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 15:2 (id: 2004015002)

2“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,


## Numbers 15:3 (id: 2004015003)

3and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh—a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a free will offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock—


## Numbers 15:4 (id: 2004015004)

4then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one fourth of a hin of oil.


## Numbers 15:5 (id: 2004015005)

5You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.


## Numbers 15:6 (id: 2004015006)

6“‘For a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil;


## Numbers 15:7 (id: 2004015007)

7and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:8 (id: 2004015008)

8When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh,


## Numbers 15:9 (id: 2004015009)

9then he shall offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil;


## Numbers 15:10 (id: 2004015010)

10and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:11 (id: 2004015011)

11Thus it shall be done for each bull, for each ram, for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.


## Numbers 15:12 (id: 2004015012)

12According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number.


## Numbers 15:13 (id: 2004015013)

13“‘All who are native\-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:14 (id: 2004015014)

14If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, as you do, so he shall do.


## Numbers 15:15 (id: 2004015015)

15For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations. As you are, so the foreigner shall be before Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:16 (id: 2004015016)

16One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.’”


## Numbers 15:17 (id: 2004015017)

17Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 15:18 (id: 2004015018)

18“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you,


## Numbers 15:19 (id: 2004015019)

19then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.


## Numbers 15:20 (id: 2004015020)

20Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering. As the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it.


## Numbers 15:21 (id: 2004015021)

21Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.


## Numbers 15:22 (id: 2004015022)

22“‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments which Yahweh has spoken to Moses—


## Numbers 15:23 (id: 2004015023)

23even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment and onward throughout your generations—


## Numbers 15:24 (id: 2004015024)

24then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.


## Numbers 15:25 (id: 2004015025)

25The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error.


## Numbers 15:26 (id: 2004015026)

26All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly.


## Numbers 15:27 (id: 2004015027)

27“‘If a person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.


## Numbers 15:28 (id: 2004015028)

28The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs when he sins unwittingly before Yahweh. He shall make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.


## Numbers 15:29 (id: 2004015029)

29You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native\-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.


## Numbers 15:30 (id: 2004015030)

30“‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native\-born or a foreigner, blasphemes Yahweh. That soul shall be cut off from among his people.


## Numbers 15:31 (id: 2004015031)

31Because he has despised Yahweh’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”


## Numbers 15:32 (id: 2004015032)

32While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.


## Numbers 15:33 (id: 2004015033)

33Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.


## Numbers 15:34 (id: 2004015034)

34They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.


## Numbers 15:35 (id: 2004015035)

35Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.”


## Numbers 15:36 (id: 2004015036)

36All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as Yahweh commanded Moses.


## Numbers 15:37 (id: 2004015037)

37Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 15:38 (id: 2004015038)

38“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue.


## Numbers 15:39 (id: 2004015039)

39It shall be to you for a fringe, that you may see it, and remember all Yahweh’s commandments, and do them; and that you don’t follow your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to play the prostitute;


## Numbers 15:40 (id: 2004015040)

40so that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.


## Numbers 15:41 (id: 2004015041)

41I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh your God.”


## Numbers 16:1 (id: 2004016001)

1Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took some men.


## Numbers 16:2 (id: 2004016002)

2They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown.


## Numbers 16:3 (id: 2004016003)

3They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Yahweh’s assembly?”


## Numbers 16:4 (id: 2004016004)

4When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.


## Numbers 16:5 (id: 2004016005)

5He said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning, Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him.


## Numbers 16:6 (id: 2004016006)

6Do this: have Korah and all his company take censers,


## Numbers 16:7 (id: 2004016007)

7put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!”


## Numbers 16:8 (id: 2004016008)

8Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi!


## Numbers 16:9 (id: 2004016009)

9Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Yahweh’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;


## Numbers 16:10 (id: 2004016010)

10and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also?


## Numbers 16:11 (id: 2004016011)

11Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Yahweh! What is Aaron that you complain against him?”


## Numbers 16:12 (id: 2004016012)

12Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t come up!


## Numbers 16:13 (id: 2004016013)

13Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?


## Numbers 16:14 (id: 2004016014)

14Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.”


## Numbers 16:15 (id: 2004016015)

15Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.”


## Numbers 16:16 (id: 2004016016)

16Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.


## Numbers 16:17 (id: 2004016017)

17Each man take his censer and put incense on it, and each man bring before Yahweh his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each with his censer.”


## Numbers 16:18 (id: 2004016018)

18They each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.


## Numbers 16:19 (id: 2004016019)

19Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting. Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the congregation.


## Numbers 16:20 (id: 2004016020)

20Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,


## Numbers 16:21 (id: 2004016021)

21“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!”


## Numbers 16:22 (id: 2004016022)

22They fell on their faces, and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?”


## Numbers 16:23 (id: 2004016023)

23Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 16:24 (id: 2004016024)

24“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’”


## Numbers 16:25 (id: 2004016025)

25Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.


## Numbers 16:26 (id: 2004016026)

26He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!”


## Numbers 16:27 (id: 2004016027)

27So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.


## Numbers 16:28 (id: 2004016028)

28Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.


## Numbers 16:29 (id: 2004016029)

29If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn’t sent me.


## Numbers 16:30 (id: 2004016030)

30But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh.”


## Numbers 16:31 (id: 2004016031)

31As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart.


## Numbers 16:32 (id: 2004016032)

32The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households, all of Korah’s men, and all their goods.


## Numbers 16:33 (id: 2004016033)

33So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol. The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.


## Numbers 16:34 (id: 2004016034)

34All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”


## Numbers 16:35 (id: 2004016035)

35Fire came out from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.


## Numbers 16:36 (id: 2004016036)

36Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 16:37 (id: 2004016037)

37“Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy,


## Numbers 16:38 (id: 2004016038)

38even the censers of those who sinned against their own lives. Let them be beaten into plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel.”


## Numbers 16:39 (id: 2004016039)

39Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,


## Numbers 16:40 (id: 2004016040)

40to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger who isn’t of the offspring of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that he not be as Korah and as his company; as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.


## Numbers 16:41 (id: 2004016041)

41But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed Yahweh’s people!”


## Numbers 16:42 (id: 2004016042)

42When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and Yahweh’s glory appeared.


## Numbers 16:43 (id: 2004016043)

43Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.


## Numbers 16:44 (id: 2004016044)

44Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 16:45 (id: 2004016045)

45“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces.


## Numbers 16:46 (id: 2004016046)

46Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on it, carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague has begun.”


## Numbers 16:47 (id: 2004016047)

47Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. The plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.


## Numbers 16:48 (id: 2004016048)

48He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.


## Numbers 16:49 (id: 2004016049)

49Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, in addition to those who died about the matter of Korah.


## Numbers 16:50 (id: 2004016050)

50Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped.


## Numbers 17:1 (id: 2004017001)

1Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 17:2 (id: 2004017002)

2“Speak to the children of Israel, and take rods from them, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods. Write each man’s name on his rod.


## Numbers 17:3 (id: 2004017003)

3You shall write Aaron’s name on Levi’s rod. There shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.


## Numbers 17:4 (id: 2004017004)

4You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the covenant, where I meet with you.


## Numbers 17:5 (id: 2004017005)

5It shall happen that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud. I will make the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you, cease from me.”


## Numbers 17:6 (id: 2004017006)

6Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, a total of twelve rods. Aaron’s rod was among their rods.


## Numbers 17:7 (id: 2004017007)

7Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the Tent of the Testimony.


## Numbers 17:8 (id: 2004017008)

8On the next day, Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony; and behold, Aaron’s rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.


## Numbers 17:9 (id: 2004017009)

9Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel. They looked, and each man took his rod.


## Numbers 17:10 (id: 2004017010)

10Yahweh said to Moses, “Put back the rod of Aaron before the covenant, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their complaining against me, that they not die.”


## Numbers 17:11 (id: 2004017011)

11Moses did so. As Yahweh commanded him, so he did.


## Numbers 17:12 (id: 2004017012)

12The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone!


## Numbers 17:13 (id: 2004017013)

13Everyone who keeps approaching Yahweh’s tabernacle, dies! Will we all perish?”


## Numbers 18:1 (id: 2004018001)

1Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your fathers’ house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.


## Numbers 18:2 (id: 2004018002)

2Bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you; but you and your sons with you shall be before the Tent of the Testimony.


## Numbers 18:3 (id: 2004018003)

3They shall keep your commands and the duty of the whole Tent; only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they nor you.


## Numbers 18:4 (id: 2004018004)

4They shall be joined to you and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. A stranger shall not come near to you.


## Numbers 18:5 (id: 2004018005)

5“You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary and the duty of the altar, that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel.


## Numbers 18:6 (id: 2004018006)

6Behold, I myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel. They are a gift to you, dedicated to Yahweh, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting.


## Numbers 18:7 (id: 2004018007)

7You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil. You shall serve. I give you the service of the priesthood as a gift. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.”


## Numbers 18:8 (id: 2004018008)

8Yahweh spoke to Aaron, “Behold, I myself have given you the command of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel. I have given them to you by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever.


## Numbers 18:9 (id: 2004018009)

9This shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.


## Numbers 18:10 (id: 2004018010)

10You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.


## Numbers 18:11 (id: 2004018011)

11“This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.


## Numbers 18:12 (id: 2004018012)

12“I have given to you all the best of the oil, all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh.


## Numbers 18:13 (id: 2004018013)

13The first\-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Yahweh, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it.


## Numbers 18:14 (id: 2004018014)

14“Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.


## Numbers 18:15 (id: 2004018015)

15Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal, shall be yours. Nevertheless, you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals.


## Numbers 18:16 (id: 2004018016)

16You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels of money, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which weighs twenty gerahs.


## Numbers 18:17 (id: 2004018017)

17“But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.


## Numbers 18:18 (id: 2004018018)

18Their meat shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.


## Numbers 18:19 (id: 2004018019)

19All the wave offerings of the holy things which the children of Israel offer to Yahweh, I have given you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever. It is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to your offspring with you.”


## Numbers 18:20 (id: 2004018020)

20Yahweh said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.


## Numbers 18:21 (id: 2004018021)

21“To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting.


## Numbers 18:22 (id: 2004018022)

22Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.


## Numbers 18:23 (id: 2004018023)

23But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. Among the children of Israel, they shall have no inheritance.


## Numbers 18:24 (id: 2004018024)

24For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, ‘Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.’”


## Numbers 18:25 (id: 2004018025)

25Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,


## Numbers 18:26 (id: 2004018026)

26“Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, ‘When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe.


## Numbers 18:27 (id: 2004018027)

27Your wave offering shall be credited to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.


## Numbers 18:28 (id: 2004018028)

28Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give Yahweh’s wave offering to Aaron the priest.


## Numbers 18:29 (id: 2004018029)

29Out of all your gifts, you shall offer every wave offering to Yahweh, of all its best parts, even the holy part of it.’


## Numbers 18:30 (id: 2004018030)

30“Therefore you shall tell them, ‘When you heave its best from it, then it shall be credited to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press.


## Numbers 18:31 (id: 2004018031)

31You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting.


## Numbers 18:32 (id: 2004018032)

32You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it its best. You shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.’”


## Numbers 19:1 (id: 2004019001)

1Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,


## Numbers 19:2 (id: 2004019002)

2“This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded. Tell the children of Israel to bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no defect, and which was never yoked.


## Numbers 19:3 (id: 2004019003)

3You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face.


## Numbers 19:4 (id: 2004019004)

4Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times.

2There was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

3The people quarreled with Moses, and spoke, saying, “We wish that we had died when our brothers died before Yahweh!


## Numbers 20:4 (id: 2004020004)

4Why have you brought Yahweh’s assembly into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals?


## Numbers 20:5 (id: 2004020005)

5Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.”


## Numbers 20:6 (id: 2004020006)

13These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.

14Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: “Your brother Israel says: You know all the travail that has happened to us;


## Numbers 20:15 (id: 2004020015)

15how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers.


## Numbers 20:16 (id: 2004020016)

## Numbers 20:17 (id: 2004020017)

17“Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the king’s highway. We will not turn away to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.”


## Numbers 20:18 (id: 2004020018)

18Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.”


## Numbers 20:19 (id: 2004020019)

19The children of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.”


## Numbers 20:20 (id: 2004020020)

20He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.


## Numbers 20:21 (id: 2004020021)

21Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.


## Numbers 20:22 (id: 2004020022)

22They traveled from Kadesh, and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.


## Numbers 20:23 (id: 2004020023)

23Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,


## Numbers 20:24 (id: 2004020024)

25Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;

26and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron shall be gathered, and shall die there.”


## Numbers 20:27 (id: 2004020027)

27Moses did as Yahweh commanded. They went up onto Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.


## Numbers 20:28 (id: 2004020028)

28Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.


## Numbers 20:29 (id: 2004020029)

29When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.


## Numbers 21:1 (id: 2004021001)

1The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim. He fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.


## Numbers 21:2 (id: 2004021002)

2Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.”


## Numbers 21:3 (id: 2004021003)

3Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was called Hormah.


## Numbers 21:4 (id: 2004021004)

4They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey.


## Numbers 21:5 (id: 2004021005)

5The people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, there is no water, and our soul loathes this disgusting food!”


## Numbers 21:6 (id: 2004021006)

6Yahweh sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel died.


## Numbers 21:7 (id: 2004021007)

7The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us.” Moses prayed for the people.


## Numbers 21:8 (id: 2004021008)

8Yahweh said to Moses, “Make a venomous snake, and set it on a pole. It shall happen that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.”


## Numbers 21:9 (id: 2004021009)

9Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, he lived.


## Numbers 21:10 (id: 2004021010)

10The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.


## Numbers 21:11 (id: 2004021011)

11They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.


## Numbers 21:12 (id: 2004021012)

12From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.


## Numbers 21:13 (id: 2004021013)

13From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.


## Numbers 21:14 (id: 2004021014)

14Therefore it is said in The Book of the Wars of Yahweh, “Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,


## Numbers 21:15 (id: 2004021015)

15the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.”


## Numbers 21:16 (id: 2004021016)

16From there they traveled to Beer; that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”


## Numbers 21:17 (id: 2004021017)

17Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, well! Sing to it,


## Numbers 21:18 (id: 2004021018)

18the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles.” From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;


## Numbers 21:19 (id: 2004021019)

19and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;


## Numbers 21:20 (id: 2004021020)

20and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.


## Numbers 21:21 (id: 2004021021)

21Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,


## Numbers 21:22 (id: 2004021022)

22“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn away into field or vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.”


## Numbers 21:23 (id: 2004021023)

23Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel.


## Numbers 21:24 (id: 2004021024)

24Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was fortified.


## Numbers 21:25 (id: 2004021025)

25Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.


## Numbers 21:26 (id: 2004021026)

26For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.


## Numbers 21:27 (id: 2004021027)

27Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established;


## Numbers 21:28 (id: 2004021028)

28for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.


## Numbers 21:29 (id: 2004021029)

29Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.


## Numbers 21:30 (id: 2004021030)

30We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba.”


## Numbers 21:31 (id: 2004021031)

31Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.


## Numbers 21:32 (id: 2004021032)

32Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites who were there.


## Numbers 21:33 (id: 2004021033)

33They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.


## Numbers 21:34 (id: 2004021034)

34Yahweh said to Moses, “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.”


## Numbers 21:35 (id: 2004021035)

35So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land.


## Numbers 22:1 (id: 2004022001)

1The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.


## Numbers 22:2 (id: 2004022002)

2Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.


## Numbers 22:3 (id: 2004022003)

3Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.


## Numbers 22:4 (id: 2004022004)

4Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.


## Numbers 22:5 (id: 2004022005)

5He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.


## Numbers 22:6 (id: 2004022006)

6Please come now therefore, and curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”


## Numbers 22:7 (id: 2004022007)

7The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.


## Numbers 22:8 (id: 2004022008)

8He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.


## Numbers 22:9 (id: 2004022009)

9God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?”


## Numbers 22:10 (id: 2004022010)

10Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me,


## Numbers 22:11 (id: 2004022011)

11‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’”


## Numbers 22:12 (id: 2004022012)

12God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.”


## Numbers 22:13 (id: 2004022013)

13Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you.”


## Numbers 22:14 (id: 2004022014)

14The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”


## Numbers 22:15 (id: 2004022015)

15Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they.


## Numbers 22:16 (id: 2004022016)

16They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Balak the son of Zippor says, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,


## Numbers 22:17 (id: 2004022017)

17for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’”


## Numbers 22:18 (id: 2004022018)

18Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.


## Numbers 22:19 (id: 2004022019)

19Now therefore please stay here tonight as well, that I may know what else Yahweh will speak to me.”


## Numbers 22:20 (id: 2004022020)

20God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.”


## Numbers 22:21 (id: 2004022021)

21Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.


## Numbers 22:22 (id: 2004022022)

22God’s anger burned because he went; and Yahweh’s angel placed himself in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.


## Numbers 22:23 (id: 2004022023)

23The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned out of the path, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the path.


## Numbers 22:24 (id: 2004022024)

24Then Yahweh’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.


## Numbers 22:25 (id: 2004022025)

25The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again.


## Numbers 22:26 (id: 2004022026)

26Yahweh’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.


## Numbers 22:27 (id: 2004022027)

27The donkey saw Yahweh’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff.


## Numbers 22:28 (id: 2004022028)

28Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”


## Numbers 22:29 (id: 2004022029)

29Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.”


## Numbers 22:30 (id: 2004022030)

30The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?” He said, “No.”


## Numbers 22:31 (id: 2004022031)

31Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw Yahweh’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.


## Numbers 22:32 (id: 2004022032)

32Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me.


## Numbers 22:33 (id: 2004022033)

33The donkey saw me, and turned away before me these three times. Unless she had turned away from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.”


## Numbers 22:34 (id: 2004022034)

34Balaam said to Yahweh’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.”


## Numbers 22:35 (id: 2004022035)

35Yahweh’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but you shall only speak the word that I shall speak to you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.


## Numbers 22:36 (id: 2004022036)

36When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.


## Numbers 22:37 (id: 2004022037)

37Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send for you to summon you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?”


## Numbers 22:38 (id: 2004022038)

38Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? I will speak the word that God puts in my mouth.”


## Numbers 22:39 (id: 2004022039)

39Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.


## Numbers 22:40 (id: 2004022040)

40Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.


## Numbers 22:41 (id: 2004022041)

41In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people.


## Numbers 23:1 (id: 2004023001)

1Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.”


## Numbers 23:2 (id: 2004023002)

2Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.


## Numbers 23:3 (id: 2004023003)

3Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.” He went to a bare height.


## Numbers 23:4 (id: 2004023004)

4God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.”


## Numbers 23:5 (id: 2004023005)

5Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”


## Numbers 23:6 (id: 2004023006)

6He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.


## Numbers 23:7 (id: 2004023007)

7He took up his parable, and said, “From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel.


## Numbers 23:8 (id: 2004023008)
