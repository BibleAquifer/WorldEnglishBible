3to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;


## Proverbs 1:4 (id: 2020001004)

## Proverbs 1:5 (id: 2020001005)

5that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel;


## Proverbs 1:6 (id: 2020001006)

6to understand a proverb and parables, the words and riddles of the wise.

## Proverbs 1:8 (id: 2020001008)

8My son, listen to your father’s instruction, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching;


## Proverbs 1:9 (id: 2020001009)

9for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains around your neck.


## Proverbs 1:10 (id: 2020001010)

10My son, if sinners entice you, don’t consent.


## Proverbs 1:11 (id: 2020001011)

11If they say, “Come with us. Let’s lie in wait for blood. Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.


## Proverbs 1:12 (id: 2020001012)

12Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down into the pit.


## Proverbs 1:13 (id: 2020001013)

13We’ll find all valuable wealth. We’ll fill our houses with plunder.


## Proverbs 1:14 (id: 2020001014)

14You shall cast your lot among us. We’ll all have one purse”—


## Proverbs 1:15 (id: 2020001015)

15my son, don’t walk on the path with them. Keep your foot from their path,


## Proverbs 1:16 (id: 2020001016)

16for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.


## Proverbs 1:17 (id: 2020001017)

17For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;


## Proverbs 1:18 (id: 2020001018)

18but these lay in wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.


## Proverbs 1:19 (id: 2020001019)

19So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners.


## Proverbs 1:20 (id: 2020001020)

20Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares.


## Proverbs 1:21 (id: 2020001021)

21She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:


## Proverbs 1:22 (id: 2020001022)

22“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge?


## Proverbs 1:23 (id: 2020001023)

23Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you.


## Proverbs 1:24 (id: 2020001024)

24Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;


## Proverbs 1:25 (id: 2020001025)

25but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;


## Proverbs 1:26 (id: 2020001026)

26I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you,


## Proverbs 1:27 (id: 2020001027)

27when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come on you.


## Proverbs 1:28 (id: 2020001028)

28Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me,


## Proverbs 1:29 (id: 2020001029)

29because they hated knowledge, and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.


## Proverbs 1:30 (id: 2020001030)

30They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.


## Proverbs 1:31 (id: 2020001031)

31Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes.


## Proverbs 1:32 (id: 2020001032)

32For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them.


## Proverbs 1:33 (id: 2020001033)

33But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”


## Proverbs 2:1 (id: 2020002001)

1My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my commandments within you,


## Proverbs 2:2 (id: 2020002002)

2so as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;


## Proverbs 2:3 (id: 2020002003)

3yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your voice for understanding;


## Proverbs 2:4 (id: 2020002004)

4if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures;


## Proverbs 2:5 (id: 2020002005)

5then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God.


## Proverbs 2:6 (id: 2020002006)

6For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.

12to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things,


## Proverbs 2:13 (id: 2020002013)

13who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness,


## Proverbs 2:14 (id: 2020002014)

14who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil,


## Proverbs 2:15 (id: 2020002015)

15who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths,


## Proverbs 2:16 (id: 2020002016)

16to deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,


## Proverbs 2:17 (id: 2020002017)

17who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God;


## Proverbs 2:18 (id: 2020002018)

18for her house leads down to death, her paths to the departed spirits.

19None who go to her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life.

2for they will add to you length of days, years of life, and peace.


## Proverbs 3:3 (id: 2020003003)

4So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

16For they don’t sleep unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.


## Proverbs 4:17 (id: 2020004017)

17For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.

18But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light that shines more and more until the perfect day.

## Proverbs 5:2 (id: 2020005002)

2that you may maintain discretion, that your lips may preserve knowledge.


## Proverbs 5:3 (id: 2020005003)

3For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil,


## Proverbs 5:4 (id: 2020005004)

4but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two\-edged sword.


## Proverbs 5:5 (id: 2020005005)

5Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol.

7Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.


## Proverbs 5:8 (id: 2020005008)

8Remove your way far from her. Don’t come near the door of her house,


## Proverbs 5:9 (id: 2020005009)

9lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;


## Proverbs 5:10 (id: 2020005010)

10lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich another man’s house.


## Proverbs 5:11 (id: 2020005011)

11You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your body are consumed,


## Proverbs 5:12 (id: 2020005012)

12and say, “How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof.


## Proverbs 5:13 (id: 2020005013)

13I haven’t obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!


## Proverbs 5:14 (id: 2020005014)

14I have come to the brink of utter ruin, among the gathered assembly.”


## Proverbs 5:15 (id: 2020005015)

15Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of your own well.


## Proverbs 5:16 (id: 2020005016)

16Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares?


## Proverbs 5:17 (id: 2020005017)

17Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.


## Proverbs 5:18 (id: 2020005018)

18Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.


## Proverbs 5:19 (id: 2020005019)

19A loving doe and a graceful deer— let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love.


## Proverbs 5:20 (id: 2020005020)

20For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another?


## Proverbs 5:21 (id: 2020005021)

21For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes. He examines all his paths.


## Proverbs 5:22 (id: 2020005022)

22The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly.


## Proverbs 5:23 (id: 2020005023)

23He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.


## Proverbs 6:1 (id: 2020006001)

1My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,


## Proverbs 6:2 (id: 2020006002)

2you are trapped by the words of your mouth; you are ensnared with the words of your mouth.


## Proverbs 6:3 (id: 2020006003)

3Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor.


## Proverbs 6:4 (id: 2020006004)

4Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.


## Proverbs 6:5 (id: 2020006005)

5Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.


## Proverbs 6:6 (id: 2020006006)

6Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise;


## Proverbs 6:7 (id: 2020006007)

7which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,


## Proverbs 6:8 (id: 2020006008)

8provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.


## Proverbs 6:9 (id: 2020006009)

9How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?


## Proverbs 6:10 (id: 2020006010)

10A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep—


## Proverbs 6:11 (id: 2020006011)

11so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity as an armed man.


## Proverbs 6:12 (id: 2020006012)

12A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth,


## Proverbs 6:13 (id: 2020006013)

13who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers,


## Proverbs 6:14 (id: 2020006014)

14in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who always sows discord.


## Proverbs 6:15 (id: 2020006015)

15Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.


## Proverbs 6:16 (id: 2020006016)

16There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are an abomination to him:


## Proverbs 6:17 (id: 2020006017)

17arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,


## Proverbs 6:18 (id: 2020006018)

18a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,


## Proverbs 6:19 (id: 2020006019)

19a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.


## Proverbs 6:20 (id: 2020006020)

20My son, keep your father’s commandment, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.


## Proverbs 6:21 (id: 2020006021)

21Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.


## Proverbs 6:22 (id: 2020006022)

22When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you.


## Proverbs 6:23 (id: 2020006023)

23For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,


## Proverbs 6:24 (id: 2020006024)

24to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.


## Proverbs 6:25 (id: 2020006025)

25Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.


## Proverbs 6:26 (id: 2020006026)

26For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.


## Proverbs 6:27 (id: 2020006027)

27Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?


## Proverbs 6:28 (id: 2020006028)

28Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?


## Proverbs 6:29 (id: 2020006029)

29So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.


## Proverbs 6:30 (id: 2020006030)

30Men don’t despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry,


## Proverbs 6:31 (id: 2020006031)

31but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house.


## Proverbs 6:32 (id: 2020006032)

32He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.
