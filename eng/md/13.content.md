9When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.

10Yahweh’s anger burned against Uzza, and he struck him because he put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.

12and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it.


## 1 Chronicles 15:13 (id: 2013015013)

## 1 Chronicles 16:26 (id: 2013016026)

26For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.


## 1 Chronicles 16:27 (id: 2013016027)

31Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice! Let them say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns!”

32Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let the field exult, and all that is in it!

## 1 Chronicles 16:37 (id: 2013016037)

38and Obed\-Edom with their sixty\-eight relatives; Obed\-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;

## 1 Chronicles 17:1 (id: 2013017001)

1When David was living in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I live in a cedar house, but the ark of Yahweh’s covenant is in a tent.”


## 1 Chronicles 17:2 (id: 2013017002)

2Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 17:3 (id: 2013017003)

3That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,


## 1 Chronicles 17:4 (id: 2013017004)

4“Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in;


## 1 Chronicles 17:5 (id: 2013017005)

5for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.


## 1 Chronicles 17:6 (id: 2013017006)

6In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’


## 1 Chronicles 17:7 (id: 2013017007)

7“Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 17:8 (id: 2013017008)

8I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.


## 1 Chronicles 17:9 (id: 2013017009)

9I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first,


## 1 Chronicles 17:10 (id: 2013017010)

10and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.


## 1 Chronicles 17:11 (id: 2013017011)

11It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.


## 1 Chronicles 17:12 (id: 2013017012)

12He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.


## 1 Chronicles 17:13 (id: 2013017013)

13I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you;


## 1 Chronicles 17:14 (id: 2013017014)

14but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever.”’”


## 1 Chronicles 17:15 (id: 2013017015)

15According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.


## 1 Chronicles 17:16 (id: 2013017016)

16Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?


## 1 Chronicles 17:17 (id: 2013017017)

17This was a small thing in your eyes, O God, but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.


## 1 Chronicles 17:18 (id: 2013017018)

18What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.


## 1 Chronicles 17:19 (id: 2013017019)

19Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.


## 1 Chronicles 17:20 (id: 2013017020)

20Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.


## 1 Chronicles 17:21 (id: 2013017021)

21What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people whom you redeemed out of Egypt?


## 1 Chronicles 17:22 (id: 2013017022)

22For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.


## 1 Chronicles 17:23 (id: 2013017023)

23Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.


## 1 Chronicles 17:24 (id: 2013017024)

24Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’


## 1 Chronicles 17:25 (id: 2013017025)

25For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.


## 1 Chronicles 17:26 (id: 2013017026)

26Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.


## 1 Chronicles 17:27 (id: 2013017027)

27Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”

## 1 Chronicles 18:9 (id: 2013018009)

9When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,


## 1 Chronicles 18:10 (id: 2013018010)

10he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze.


## 1 Chronicles 18:11 (id: 2013018011)

11King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations: from Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek.


## 1 Chronicles 18:12 (id: 2013018012)

14David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people.


## 1 Chronicles 18:15 (id: 2013018015)

## 1 Chronicles 19:1 (id: 2013019001)

1After this, Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.


## 1 Chronicles 19:2 (id: 2013019002)

2David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him.


## 1 Chronicles 19:3 (id: 2013019003)

3But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”


## 1 Chronicles 19:4 (id: 2013019004)

4So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away.


## 1 Chronicles 19:5 (id: 2013019005)

5Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”


## 1 Chronicles 19:6 (id: 2013019006)

6When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram\-maacah, and out of Zobah.


## 1 Chronicles 19:7 (id: 2013019007)

7So they hired for themselves thirty\-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.


## 1 Chronicles 19:8 (id: 2013019008)

8When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men.


## 1 Chronicles 19:9 (id: 2013019009)

9The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.


## 1 Chronicles 19:10 (id: 2013019010)

10Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.


## 1 Chronicles 19:11 (id: 2013019011)

11The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.


## 1 Chronicles 19:12 (id: 2013019012)

12He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.


## 1 Chronicles 19:13 (id: 2013019013)

13Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him.”


## 1 Chronicles 19:14 (id: 2013019014)

14So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.


## 1 Chronicles 19:15 (id: 2013019015)

15When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 19:16 (id: 2013019016)

16When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and called out the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them.


## 1 Chronicles 19:17 (id: 2013019017)

17David was told that, so he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.


## 1 Chronicles 19:18 (id: 2013019018)

18The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand footmen, and also killed Shophach the captain of the army.


## 1 Chronicles 19:19 (id: 2013019019)

19When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more.


## 1 Chronicles 20:1 (id: 2013020001)

1At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.


## 1 Chronicles 20:2 (id: 2013020002)

2David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city.


## 1 Chronicles 20:3 (id: 2013020003)

3He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 20:4 (id: 2013020004)

4After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.


## 1 Chronicles 20:5 (id: 2013020005)

5Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.


## 1 Chronicles 20:6 (id: 2013020006)

8These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.


## 1 Chronicles 21:1 (id: 2013021001)

1Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 21:2 (id: 2013021002)

2David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:3 (id: 2013021003)

3Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”


## 1 Chronicles 21:4 (id: 2013021004)

4Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 21:5 (id: 2013021005)

5Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword.


## 1 Chronicles 21:6 (id: 2013021006)

6But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.


## 1 Chronicles 21:7 (id: 2013021007)

7God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 21:8 (id: 2013021008)

8David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:9 (id: 2013021009)

9Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,


## 1 Chronicles 21:10 (id: 2013021010)

10“Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”


## 1 Chronicles 21:11 (id: 2013021011)

11So Gad came to David and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice:


## 1 Chronicles 21:12 (id: 2013021012)

12either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’”


## 1 Chronicles 21:13 (id: 2013021013)

13David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand, for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:14 (id: 2013021014)

14So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.


## 1 Chronicles 21:15 (id: 2013021015)

15God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:16 (id: 2013021016)

16David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.


## 1 Chronicles 21:17 (id: 2013021017)

17David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:18 (id: 2013021018)

18Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.


## 1 Chronicles 21:19 (id: 2013021019)

19David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name.


## 1 Chronicles 21:20 (id: 2013021020)

20Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.


## 1 Chronicles 21:21 (id: 2013021021)

21As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.


## 1 Chronicles 21:22 (id: 2013021022)

22Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:23 (id: 2013021023)

23Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:24 (id: 2013021024)

24King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:25 (id: 2013021025)

25So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.


## 1 Chronicles 21:26 (id: 2013021026)

26David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.


## 1 Chronicles 21:27 (id: 2013021027)

27Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.


## 1 Chronicles 21:28 (id: 2013021028)

28At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.


## 1 Chronicles 21:29 (id: 2013021029)

29For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.


## 1 Chronicles 21:30 (id: 2013021030)

30But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh’s angel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:1 (id: 2013022001)

1Then David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:2 (id: 2013022002)

2David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house.


## 1 Chronicles 22:3 (id: 2013022003)

3David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings, and bronze in abundance without weight,


## 1 Chronicles 22:4 (id: 2013022004)

4and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David.


## 1 Chronicles 22:5 (id: 2013022005)

5David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death.


## 1 Chronicles 22:6 (id: 2013022006)

6Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:7 (id: 2013022007)

7David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:8 (id: 2013022008)

8But Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.


## 1 Chronicles 22:9 (id: 2013022009)

9Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.


## 1 Chronicles 22:10 (id: 2013022010)

10He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’


## 1 Chronicles 22:11 (id: 2013022011)

11Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you.


## 1 Chronicles 22:12 (id: 2013022012)

12May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel, so that you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:13 (id: 2013022013)

13Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid and don’t be dismayed.


## 1 Chronicles 22:14 (id: 2013022014)

14Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them.


## 1 Chronicles 22:15 (id: 2013022015)

15There are also workmen with you in abundance—cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work;


## 1 Chronicles 22:16 (id: 2013022016)

16of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:17 (id: 2013022017)

17David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,


## 1 Chronicles 22:18 (id: 2013022018)

18“Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh and before his people.


## 1 Chronicles 22:19 (id: 2013022019)

19Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for Yahweh’s name.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:1 (id: 2013023001)

1Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 23:2 (id: 2013023002)

2He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.


## 1 Chronicles 23:3 (id: 2013023003)

3The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty\-eight thousand.


## 1 Chronicles 23:4 (id: 2013023004)

4David said, “Of these, twenty\-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh’s house, six thousand were officers and judges,


## 1 Chronicles 23:5 (id: 2013023005)

5four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made for giving praise.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:6 (id: 2013023006)

6David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.


## 1 Chronicles 23:7 (id: 2013023007)

7Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.


## 1 Chronicles 23:8 (id: 2013023008)

8The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three.


## 1 Chronicles 23:9 (id: 2013023009)

9The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan.


## 1 Chronicles 23:10 (id: 2013023010)

10The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.


## 1 Chronicles 23:11 (id: 2013023011)

11Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.


## 1 Chronicles 23:12 (id: 2013023012)

12The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.


## 1 Chronicles 23:13 (id: 2013023013)

13The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:14 (id: 2013023014)

14But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.


## 1 Chronicles 23:15 (id: 2013023015)

15The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.


## 1 Chronicles 23:16 (id: 2013023016)

16The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.


## 1 Chronicles 23:17 (id: 2013023017)

17The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.


## 1 Chronicles 23:18 (id: 2013023018)

18The son of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.


## 1 Chronicles 23:19 (id: 2013023019)

19The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.


## 1 Chronicles 23:20 (id: 2013023020)

20The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.


## 1 Chronicles 23:21 (id: 2013023021)

21The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.


## 1 Chronicles 23:22 (id: 2013023022)

22Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only; and their relatives, the sons of Kish, took them as wives.


## 1 Chronicles 23:23 (id: 2013023023)

23The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.


## 1 Chronicles 23:24 (id: 2013023024)

24These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yahweh’s house, from twenty years old and upward.


## 1 Chronicles 23:25 (id: 2013023025)

25For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:26 (id: 2013023026)

26Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:27 (id: 2013023027)

27For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward.


## 1 Chronicles 23:28 (id: 2013023028)

28For their duty was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh’s house—in the courts, in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God’s house;


## 1 Chronicles 23:29 (id: 2013023029)

29for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size;


## 1 Chronicles 23:30 (id: 2013023030)

30and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;


## 1 Chronicles 23:31 (id: 2013023031)

31and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;


## 1 Chronicles 23:32 (id: 2013023032)

32and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of Yahweh’s house.


## 1 Chronicles 24:1 (id: 2013024001)

1These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:2 (id: 2013024002)

2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.


## 1 Chronicles 24:3 (id: 2013024003)

3David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.


## 1 Chronicles 24:4 (id: 2013024004)

4There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.


## 1 Chronicles 24:5 (id: 2013024005)

5Thus they were divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:6 (id: 2013024006)

6Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.


## 1 Chronicles 24:7 (id: 2013024007)

19This was their ordering in their service, to come into Yahweh’s house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him.


## 1 Chronicles 24:20 (id: 2013024020)

## 1 Chronicles 25:1 (id: 2013025001)

1Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals. The number of those who did the work according to their service was:

## 1 Chronicles 29:3 (id: 2013029003)

4even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;


## 1 Chronicles 29:5 (id: 2013029005)

## 1 Chronicles 29:10 (id: 2013029010)

10Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.


## 1 Chronicles 29:11 (id: 2013029011)

## 1 Chronicles 29:15 (id: 2013029015)

15For we are strangers before you and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining.

16Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own.

## 1 Chronicles 29:18 (id: 2013029018)
